Roady adds features to Drummer to make it easier to work with GitHub.

The key feature is continuous, automatic backup of your Drummer files to GitHub. 
This gives you the equivalent of a time machine for your outlines, complete with diffs.

You can also upload individual Drummer files to GitHub, which can be useful for sharing your outlines with others.

Roady is currently at version 0.1.1, which is its second release.
