# ðŸŽ’ Roady
Roady adds features to Drummer to make it easier to work with GitHub.
The key feature is continuous, automatic backup of your Drummer files to GitHub. 
This gives you the equivalent of a time machine for your outlines, complete with diffs.

You can also upload individual Drummer files to GitHub, which can be useful for sharing your outlines with others.

Roady is currently at version 0.3.0.

## To install the ðŸŽ’ Roady menu
Follow these steps to copy the latest version of the  ðŸŽ’ Roady menu from GitHub into your Scripts menu file
1. File â†’ Open URLâ€¦  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PostMonsterG/Roady/main/Roady.opml`

3. Copy (âŒ˜C)
4. File â†’ Special Filesâ€¦ â†’ Scripts menu...

You should now have a new ðŸŽ’ menu. The backpack is just an emoji, you can name the menu anything you like, including "Roady".
You can uninstall Roady by deleting this entry in your scripts menu, or temporarily disable it by commenting it out. 

## To back up your files
Roady lets you use a GitHub repository to store a backup copy of your Drummer files. 
Each file is saved as a separate file, there is no zip archive. 
These are incremental backups, only those files modified or created since the last backup will be uploaded. 

#### Have these things ready before you continue
- GitHub account username
- Private repository to save your backups into, e.g., `drummer-private-backups`
- Path to a folder in the repository, e.g., `mybackups`

#### To configure Roady and connect Drummer to GitHub
1. ðŸŽ’ Preferences â†’ Configure GitHub Usernameâ€¦ 
2. ðŸŽ’ Preferences â†’ Configure Backups Repositoryâ€¦ 
3. ðŸŽ’ Preferences â†’ Configure Backups Pathâ€¦ 
4. ðŸŽ’ Status â†’ Connect to GitHubâ€¦ 

#### To back up your files
1. ðŸŽ’ Back Up Now 

Roady logs information to the console about the files it has uploaded. Look for the backpack emoji.

## To configure backups
You can tell Roady to skip backing up outlines if all you did was move the cursor or expand/collapse nodes.
- ðŸŽ’ Preferences â†’ Exclude Cursor Updates
- ðŸŽ’ Preferences â†’ Include Cursor Updates
- ðŸŽ’ Preferences â†’ Exclude Expansion Updates
- ðŸŽ’ Preferences â†’ Include Expansion Updates


## To enable automatic backups
Roady will back up your files to GitHub each time you select the ðŸŽ’ **Back Up Now** command. You can enable automatic backups by copying this command into Drummer's scheduler. 
1. File â†’ Special Files... â†’ Scripts menuâ€¦ 
2. Select the **Back Up Now** node 
3. Copy (âŒ˜C)
4. File â†’ Special Files... â†’ Schedulerâ€¦ 
5. Ensure there is a top-level, uncommented, node named `everyMinute`
6. Paste (âŒ˜V) the **Back Up Now** item under that heading

You can turn off automatic backups by deleting this item from Drummer's scheduler, or temporarily disable them by commenting it out.
Roady logs information to the console about the files it has uploaded. Look for the backpack emoji.

## To verify backups status
Roady can show you when it last scanned for changes, and when, and how many, files it last backed up.
1. ðŸŽ’ Status â†’ Backup Statusâ€¦ 
<img width="398" alt="BackupStatusDialog-020" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93412909/148423633-c47b07d3-da99-41af-9539-815c345f6220.png">
	
## To restore your files
Roady does not have any special features for restoring files from GitHub. For now, do this by hand.

## To upload a Drummer file to GitHub
Roady lets you upload individual Drummer files to GitHub. This is a separate thing from backupsâ€”it is for sharing your outlines with others. 
1.  ðŸŽ’ Upload Current Tabâ€¦

#### To select how uploaded outlines appear in Drummer
By default, outlines uploaded by Roady as OPML will appear in Drummer as an "instant outline", with a lightning bolt. Roady can adjust the OPML it uploads so the outline appears with a globe icon.
- ðŸŽ’ Preferences â†’ Upload Tabs as Public Outline
- ðŸŽ’ Preferences â†’ Upload Tabs as Instant Outline

#### To configure a file for upload
Roady  looks for header elements in the OPML to determine where to save the file and how it is processed. 
- `rd-repository`
Set this to the name of the GitHub repository you want to save the file into.
For example, `hello-world`

- `rd-path`
Set this to the path to the file, including the filename.  
For example, `directory/sub/file.opml`

- `rd-type`
Controls how the file is processed before uploading.

    - `opml`
The OPML file will be uploaded. If you have selected *Upload Tabs as Public Outline*, Roady will remove the `urlUpdateSocket` header element.

    - `text`
Suitable for Markdown, the text from the nodes of the outline will be included, but none of the indentation or OPML attributes.

    - `indented`
Suitable for JavaScript, the text from the nodes of the outline will be included, with indentation per OPML indentation level.

## What Roady does with your data 
- *Important:* Roady uploads your files to GitHub. Roady cannot tell, and will not warn you, if you upload private files to a public repository.
- Roady stores settings and status information in your web browser's local storage. This remains after you remove Roady from your scripts menu and scheduler. Your web browser will have controls for managing this data.
- Roady treats GitHub as a write-only file system. It commits everything to the main branch, and does not understand revisions, history, or the difference between public and private repositories. Roady is not appropriate for use as a general-purpose client for GitHub.

## Release history
